            <strong>Eid al-Fitr</strong> (Arabic: عيد الفطر‎, romanized: ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, lit. 'Feast of Breaking the Fast',
            also called the <strong>"Festival of Breaking the Fast"</strong> or Lesser Eid, or simply Eid, is a
            religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset
            fasting of Ramadan.The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is
            sighted by local religious authorities, so the day of celebration varies by locality. The holiday is known
            under various other names in different languages and countries around the world.
            <br>
            Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat (Islamic prayer) that consists of two rakats (units) generally performed
            in an open field or large hall. It may only be performed in congregation (jamāʿat) and features six
            additional Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears while saying "Allāhu ʾAkbar", meaning "God is the
            greatest") in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam: three at the start of the first rakat and three just before
            rukūʿ in the second rakat. Other Sunni schools usually have 12 Takbirs, similarly split in groups of seven
            and five. In Shia Islam, the salat has six Takbirs in the first rakat at the end of qira'a, before rukūʿ,
            and five in the second. Depending on the juristic opinion of the locality, this salat is either farḍ
            (<strong>فرض</strong>, obligatory), mustaḥabb (strongly recommended) or mandūb (<strong>مندوب</strong>,
            preferable). After the salat, Muslims celebrate the Eid al-Fitr in various ways with food ("Eid cuisine")
            being a central theme, which also gives the holiday the nickname "Sweet Eid" or "Sugar Feast".
            <br> <br> <strong>History</strong> <br>
            Eid al-Fitr was originated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. According to certain traditions, these festivals
            were initiated in Medina after the migration of Muhammad from Mecca. Anas, a well-known companion of the
            Islamic prophet, narrated that, when Muhammad arrived in Medina, he found people celebrating two specific
            days in which they entertained themselves with recreation and merriment. At this, Muhammad remarked that
            Allah had fixed two days of festivity: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
            <br><br>
            <strong>General rituals</strong> <br>
            Traditionally, Eid al-Fitr begins at sunset on the night of the first sighting of the crescent moon. If the
            moon is not observed immediately after the 29th day of the previous lunar month (either because clouds block
            its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the holiday is celebrated
            the following day.[12] Eid al-Fitr is celebrated for one to three days, depending on the country.[13] It is
            forbidden to fast on the Day of Eid, and a specific prayer is nominated for this day.[14] As an obligatory
            act of charity, money is paid to the poor and the needy (Zakat-ul-fitr) before performing the ‘Eid prayer.

            <strong>Eid prayer and eidgah</strong> <br>
            Further information: Eid prayers and Eidgah
            The Eid prayer is performed by the congregation in an open area such as a field, community center, or
            mosque.[13] No call to prayer is given for this Eid prayer, and it consists of only two units of prayer,
            with a variable amount of Takbirs and other prayer elements depending on the branch of Islam observed. The
            Eid prayer is followed by the sermon and then a supplication asking for Allah's forgiveness, mercy, peace
            and blessings for all living beings across the world. The sermon also instructs Muslims as to the
            performance of rituals of Eid, such as the zakat.[16] The sermon of Eid takes place after the Eid prayer,
            unlike Friday prayer which comes first before prayer. Some imams believe that listening to the sermon at Eid
            is optional.[17] After the prayers, Muslims visit their relatives, friends, and acquaintances or hold large
            communal celebrations in homes, community centers, or rented halls.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Sunni procedure</strong> <br>
            As ritual dictates, Sunnis praise Allah in a loud voice while going to the Eid prayer:
            <br>
            Allāhu Akbar, Allāhu Akbar, Allāhu Akbar. Lā ilāha illà l-Lāh wal-Lāhu akbar, Allahu akbar walil-Lāhi l-ḥamd
            <br>
            Recitation ceases when they get to the place of Eid or once the Imam commences activities.[18]
            <br>
            The prayer starts by doing "Niyyat" for the prayer, before the Takbir is said by the Imam and his followers.
            Next, "Takbeer-e-Tehreema" is recited, followed by Allahu Akbar three times, raising hands to the ears and
            dropping them each time, except for the last when the hands are folded. The Imam then reads the
            Surah-e-Fatiha, as well as other Surah. The congregation performs Ruku and Sujud as in other prayers. This
            completes the first rakat.
            <br>
            The congregation rises up and folds their hands for the second rakat, during which the Imam recites Surah
            Fatiha and another Surah. After this, three Takbirs are called out just before the Ruku, each time raising
            hands to the ears and dropping them. For the fourth time, the congregation says Allah o Akbar and
            subsequently goes into the Ruku. The rest of the prayer is completed in the regular manner. This completes
            the Eid prayer. After the prayer, there is a khutbah.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Shia procedure</strong> <br>
            Prayer starts with the Niyyat followed by five Takbirs. During every Takbir of the first rakat, a special
            Dua is recited. Then, the Imam recites Sūrat al-Fātiḥah and Surat Al-'A`lá and the congregation performs
            Ruku and Sujud as in other prayers. In the second Rakat, the same above steps (five Takbeers, Sūrat
            al-Fātiḥah and Surat Al-'A`lá, Ruku and Sujud) are repeated. After the prayer, Khutbah starts.

            <br><br>

            <strong>Post-prayer celebration</strong> <br>
            During the Eid celebration, Muslims greet each other by saying 'Eid Mubarak', which is Arabic for "Blessed
            Eid". As it comes after a month of fasting, sweet dishes and foods are often prepared and consumed during
            the celebration. Muslims typically decorate their homes, and are also encouraged to forgive each other and
            seek forgiveness. In countries with large Muslim populations, it is normally a public holiday with most
            schools and businesses closed for the day. Practices differ by country and region.
